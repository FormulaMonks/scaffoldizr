## Workspace preview

Once a Structurizr Workspace is created, you can preview it using [Structurizr/lite](https://docs.structurizr.com/lite) in your local machine, as long as you have [Docker](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop/) running. To run your created Workspace, you can find a generated bash shell script under `/your-path/to/docs/architecture/scripts/run.sh`. It will run an ephemeral container that will close once you end the process.

Default port is `8080`. You can change it by setting a different port at the beginning of the command:

```bash
/your-path/to/docs/architecture/scripts/run.sh 7311
```
