# Motivation

[Structurizr Workspaces](https://docs.structurizr.com/workspaces) are a great way to document and share architecture diagrams in the [C4 model](https://c4model.com/). However, the diagram creation is freeform and there are no guidelines to break code into files, leaving architects and developers with a feeling of not knowing where to start.

This is an opinionated scaffolding tool written in TypeScript/[Bun](https://bun.sh/) that attempts to create the building blocks of a solid system architecture documentation, that eases up the entry barrier for newcomers as well as allowing architects experienced in Structurizr to follow a convention while setting them up for success.
